 <br><br><br><br><br>In the land of Avalonia you find yourself living the lifestyle as a farmer in Hollowtown.
Hollowtown is no ordinary town. It can be very dangerous at times. Hollowtown is settled next to a
cursed forest called the Neverfree forest. It's known to be infested with creatures not known to man
It is a thickly dense swarmp that takes pride in making it the most inhabitable place for man.
Unfortunately your sister has mysteriously disappeared, and after asking the locals, most of them would say
the forest took her. It's up to you to save her.
